# Discord Dom Inspector Bot, the Abomination of Interspection

A Discord interface to [Larzm's Mod Inspector](https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/) via the [dom5api](https://github.com/gtim/dom5api). Currently available at the Immersion discord server.

Updated to discord.js v14

## Plans

**Currently working on**
* disambiguate when there's multiple matches (e.g. `/unit size 6 water elemental` and `/commander LA sauromancer`)
* mentor notes

**Small ideas / bugs to fix**
* if multiple items share the exact same name, then output all

**Potential future plans**
* site searcher (e.g. list forest sites that give order)
* item searcher (e.g. list +MR items, max const4)
* mod support, e.g. `/spell DE fuel the fire` (color-code embed)
* `/event`
* enable "more + show keys" in screenshots somehow, maybe with emoji-react?
* moving away from inspector screenshots to information in the embed itself

Small future ideas / bugs to fix

* show mage random paths
* if multiple items share the exact same name, then output all

Potential future ideas to consider 

* show stats as text instead of screenshot?
* `/nation`?
* list multiple things?
