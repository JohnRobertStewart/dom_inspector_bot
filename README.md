# Discord Dom Inspector Bot "Abomination of Interspection"

## A port of [Larzm's Mod Inspector](https://larzm42.github.io/dom5inspector/)

ToDo: rest of the README and add functionality to the bot.

Plans:
- Using embeds to display mod inspector info
- Interacting with the API 
- Expanding on slash commands



### Potential v1.0
- [ ] All spells, items, units, events, mercs (through screenshots)
- [ ] slash commands and !item etc functionality
- [ ] maybe some interaction emojis? (might be relegated to v2.0 when we move away from screenshots)
- [ ] mentor notes
- [ ] common aliases (like gss etc.)
- [ ] host it 

### Possible future plans / ideas

- [x] `/spell spellname`
- [x] `/unit unitname`
- [ ] mentor notes
- [ ] aliases ("gss" for greatsword of sharpness) -- maybe mentors should be able to add aliases?
- [ ] `/site sitename`
- [ ] `/merc mercname`
- [ ] compare multiple things?
- [ ] show item/unit/spell/site stats as text instead of screenshot?
- [ ] mod support? maybe something like `/spell DE fuel the fire`, `/unit WH malikastis`
- [ ] Embed color change for mod related spells, items, units etc.
- [ ] `/nation`??? to show e.g. list of commanders + path access

Minor improvements:
- [ ] `/item`: if multiple returns items share the exact same name, then output all.

Future/probably list:
- [ ] `/event eventtext`?
